The compiler exists to make code work better, not to make it work at all - when compilation fails silently, performance degrades without visibility.\n\n**Rules to Enable as Errors**:\n1. `react-hooks/todo` - Detects unsupported compiler patterns that the compiler cannot yet optimize\n2. `react-hooks/unsupported-syntax` - Catches invalid syntax (change from warn to error)\n\n**Additional Rules Provided by react-hooks plugin**:\n- `react-hooks/capitalized-calls` - Prevents calling capitalized functions instead of JSX\n- `react-hooks/hooks` - Reimplements rules-of-hooks validation\n- `react-hooks/rule-suppression` - Validates suppression usage\n- `react-hooks/syntax` - Catches invalid syntax\n\n**Common Patterns These Rules Catch**:\n- Destructuring and mutation: `function MyComponent({ value }) { value = value ?? someStateValue; }` - should use new variable\n- Complex try/catch: Conditional logic, ternaries, optional chaining within try/catch blocks prevent compilation","design":"**Note**: Uses existing `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - no new package needed, just rule configuration changes.\n\n**Configuration**:\n```javascript\nimport reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';\n\nexport default [{\n    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],\n    plugins: { 'react-hooks': reactHooks },\n    rules: {\n        ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,\n        'react-hooks/todo': 'error',\n        'react-hooks/unsupported-syntax': 'error',\n    },\n}];\n```\n\n**Integration Steps**:\n1. Locate existing react-hooks configuration in eslint.js and eslint.styled.js\n2. Add `react-hooks/todo: 'error'` rule\n3.

Follows React's \"You Might Not Need an Effect\" guide.\n\n**10 Rules Provided**:\n1. `no-derived-state` - Prevent storing derived state from props/state in effects (compute during render or use useMemo)\n2. `no-chain-state-updates` - Disallow chaining state modifications in effects (update simultaneously)\n3. `no-event-handler` - Prevent using effects as event handlers (call event logic directly)\n4. `no-adjust-state-on-prop-change` - Disallow adjusting state when props change (adjust during render)\n5. `no-reset-all-state-on-prop-change` - Prevent resetting all state on prop change (use key prop)\n6. `no-pass-live-state-to-parent` - Disallow passing live state to parents via effects (lift state up)\n7. `no-pass-data-to-parent` - Prevent passing fetched data to parents in effects (let parent fetch)\n8. `no-pass-ref-to-parent` - Disallow passing refs via effects (use forwardRef)\n9. `no-initialize-state` - Prevent initializing state in effects (initialize useState directly)\n10. `no-empty-effect` - Flag empty effects","design":"**Installation**: `pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect`\n\n**Configuration** (Flat Config):\n```javascript\nimport reactYouMightNotNeedAnEffect from \"eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect\";\n\nexport default [\n  reactYouMightNotNeedAnEffect.configs.recommended\n];\n```\n\n**Integration Steps**:\n1. Add `eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect` to peerDependencies in package.json\n2. Import and include in `eslint.js` and `eslint.styled.js` exports\n3. Use recommended preset: `reactYouMightNotNeedAnEffect.configs.recommended`\n4. Add version replacement in rollup.config.ts for bundling\n5.
