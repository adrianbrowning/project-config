The compiler exists to make code work better, not to make it work at all - when compilation fails silently, performance degrades without visibility.\n\n**Rules to Enable as Errors**:\n1. `react-hooks/todo` - Detects unsupported compiler patterns that the compiler cannot yet optimize\n2. `react-hooks/unsupported-syntax` - Catches invalid syntax (change from warn to error)\n\n**Additional Rules Provided by react-hooks plugin**:\n- `react-hooks/capitalized-calls` - Prevents calling capitalized functions instead of JSX\n- `react-hooks/hooks` - Reimplements rules-of-hooks validation\n- `react-hooks/rule-suppression` - Validates suppression usage\n- `react-hooks/syntax` - Catches invalid syntax\n\n**Common Patterns These Rules Catch**:\n- Destructuring and mutation: `function MyComponent({ value }) { value = value ?? someStateValue; }` - should use new variable\n- Complex try/catch: Conditional logic, ternaries, optional chaining within try/catch blocks prevent compilation","design":"**Note**: Uses existing `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` - no new package needed, just rule configuration changes.\n\n**Configuration**:\n```javascript\nimport reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';\n\nexport default [{\n    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],\n    plugins: { 'react-hooks': reactHooks },\n    rules: {\n        ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,\n        'react-hooks/todo': 'error',\n        'react-hooks/unsupported-syntax': 'error',\n    },\n}];\n```\n\n**Integration Steps**:\n1.
